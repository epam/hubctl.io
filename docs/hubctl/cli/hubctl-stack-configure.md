# Command: `hubctl stack configure`

Reads configuration information in one or multiple hubfiles referenced by the command `hubctl stack init` and applies configuration before the stack deployment.

When hubfile will require parameter supplied bia environment variable (`fromEnv`) ,for instance passwords or access credentials, then this command will save value for this variable in `.env` file. You can change this value later by modifying `.env` file.

Upon completion of configure command execution will ensure that all stack input parameters has been defined.

## Configuration requirements

Input parameters can be supplied by various scripts. Which exactly and it's order has been defined in hubfile via requirements

```yaml
extensions:
  configure:
  - env
  - gcp
```

List of supported requirements for configuration

| Requirement   | Description |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| `gcp` | Configures stack for deployment to GCP. Will bootstrap a DNS zone (optionally relying to bubble dns service) and a GCS bucket to store state |
| `aws` | Configures stack for deployment to AWS. Will bootstrap a Route53 zone (optionally relying to bubble dns service) and a S3 bucket to store state. This will make sure that credentials has been reachable for the deployment |
| `azure` | Similar to `aws` and `gcp` will configure stack for Microsoft Azure Cloud deployment |
| `env` | Ensures that all environment variables (`fromEnv`) has been defined by the user  |
| `kubernetes` | Reserved when user already have got a running Kubernetes cluster. This requirement may conflict if stack will actually deploy a new cluster. This requirement will ensure that kubernetes credentials stored in kubeconfig has been reachable by the kubeconfig by creating py of just one kube-context in `.hub/env` directory |
| `components` | DEPRECATED. Functionality of this requirement has been moved to  `hubctl stack init` command |
| `backup` | Activate backup/restore functionality for the stack (note that at least one component should accept verb `backup`) |

## DYI Configuration

Can I build my own configuration script for my custom case? Or override behavior of existing one? Yes just follow couple of simple steps

1. Create file: `<working-dir>/.hub/<requirement>/configure` and add execution rights
2. Write your script using: `shell` (preferably), `bash` or general purpose language of your choice.
3. Add reference to the hub.yaml

```bash
# example
mkdir -p ".hub/mysuperextension"
touch ".hub/mysuperextension/configure"
chmod +x ".hub/mysuperextension/configure"
```

then feel free to add reference that looks like the following to the `hub.yaml`

```yaml
extensions:
  configure:
  - mysuperextension
```

## Usage Example

Configure stack before deployment

```bash
hubctl stack configure
```

Reload GCP configuration, and refresh TTL for bubble DNS service

```bash
hubctl stack configure -r "gcp"
```

Configure refresh kubeconfig for kubernetes cluster (if access rotated)

```bash
hubctl stack configure -r "kubernetes"
```
