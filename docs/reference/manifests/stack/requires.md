# Section `requires`

```yaml
requires:
- aws
- kubernetes
```

Stack does not live in the vacuum. There are certain capabilities it requires from the environment before it ca nbe deployed.


Some examples of requirements:

- `aws`
- `azure`
- `gcp`
- `kubernetes`

This list is not fixed we work on continuously expanding it.
